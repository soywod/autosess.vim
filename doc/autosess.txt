*autosess.txt* - An automatic vim sessions and views manager.

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                           *autosess-introduction* 

Autosess is a wrapper around vim sessions (`:h mksession`) and vim views (`:h
mkview`). It automatically saves and restores sessions by workspace, and views
by file.

CONFIGURATION                                          *autosess-configuration* 
                                                     *autosess-session-folder* 

By default, sessions are stored in `<plugin-root>/sessions`. You can customize
the directory:
>
  let g:autosess_folder = '/my/custom/folder'
<
